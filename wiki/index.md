## Weather
In Brno, the summers are comfortable; the winters are freezing and windy, sometimes dry, sometimes wet (icy roads!), sometimes with snow (mostly higher regions); and it is partly cloudy year round. Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from -4°C to 25°C and is rarely below -11°C or above 31°C.

#Studying in Brno

>Brno is well known as a student city, you will find many people here from all over the Europe (I met many Spanish people here too). While Brno has surely things to see, it can also be a very good base for traveling around. There are airports right in Bratislava (which offers many flights from Ryanair), Vienna and Prague. There is also an airport in Brno but it's not very big one. Student life is generally great, especially if you like to party and do stuff, there will be many other fellows to do stuff with you.
I've been a member of ESN BUT and they care a lot about Erasmus students so they organize parties, trips and other activities. They also have a buddy system which can be really helpful for the beginning.

>I will rather not speak much about night life because I haven't partied that much but I would say it's pretty good. Almost every night during a semester something is happening, especially from the beginning. You will possibly have even parties at dorms so I wouldn't worry that much about that. The best thing about night life and drinking, beer here is super cheap compared to other countries. You can get some good wines too but considering your username you probably aren't fond of it.

>Lunch in a canteen will cost you about 2 - 3 euro, in a decent restaurant it can be probably somewhere 7+ euro. Public transportation card is pretty cheap which should cost you less than 30 eur for 3 months. Also I think most of other groceries will be generally cheaper. Rent in a dorm you will be living will be probably about 120/130euro per month. Beer in a pub cost around 1.1 euro, in a supermarket it can be as cheap as 0.3 euro.

>In case you would like to know which dorm will be offered to you it is Pod palackeho vrchem dorms (PPV).

>Overall Brno is a great city with lots of options but at the same time it's not that big you can easily get lost.

##Places to visit
- Lookup some "otevřené sklepy" (open wine cellars). Basically an event in some of the wine producing villages where you can tour from maker to maker, there can be some evening party as well with folk music/dancing. Sometimes happening in multiple villages so you can ride bike between them.

- If you are hardcore you can literally crawl through underground caves. https://www.kudyznudy.cz/aktivity/rudicke-propadani

- Bike single trails in Marianske Udoli and Jedovnice (at latter you can rent a downhill bike, even electric one).
